This is a bit of boilerplate for creating games in [Coquette](https://github.com/maryrosecook/coquette) using ES6 modules.

It includes a premade HTML page for your game, a preconfigured Gruntfile for building modules (with source maps), necessary dependencies (Bower & NPM), and an example entity module.

For an example game built with this boilerplate, see [Momentum](https://github.com/thomasboyt/lander).
